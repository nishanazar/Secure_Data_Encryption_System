"# Secure_Data_Encryption_System" 

## Objective
# Develop a Streamlit-based secure data storage and retrieval system where:

# Users store data with a unique passkey.
# Users decrypt data by providing the correct passkey.
# Multiple failed attempts result in a forced reauthorization (login page).
# The system operates entirely in memory without external databases.
